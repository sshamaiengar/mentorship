# Frequentist Analysis of Rosenbluth Data: A Study of Proton Form Factor Measurements

These are the Python scripts and subsequent results from this reanalysis of electron-proton scattering data from the NE11 experiment at SLAC (see [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.50.5491)).

## Dependencies
The scripts are written in Python 3.5.2, so **Python 3.0 or greater** is required. **numpy**, **scipy**, and **matplotlib** are required.

## Contents
File/Path name | Description
-------------- | ------------
Form Factors/ | Plots (PNG files) of form factors and their ratios versus Q^2 for three different analyses
chi_square.py | Performs chi-squared analysis of scattering data as reduced cross sections versus epsilon. Generates chi-squared distribution histograms.
data.csv | 8 GeV scattering data from SLAC NE11, reported by Andivahis et al. 1994
data2.csv | Annotated 8 GeV and 1.6 GeV scattering data from SLAC NE11, reported by Andivahis et al. 1994
data3.csv | **(not in use)** Annotated 8 GeV and 1.6 GeV scattering data from SLAC NE11, reported by Andivahis et al. 1994<br>1.6 GeV cross sections and errors are multiplied by a normalizing factor of 0.958.
data4.csv | **(not in use)** Annotated 8 GeV and 1.6 GeV scattering data from SLAC NE11, reported by Andivahis et al. 1994<br>1.6 GeV cross sections and errors are multiplied by a normalizing factor of 0.958. Includes values of E'.
data5.csv | Annotated 8 GeV and 1.6 GeV scattering data from SLAC NE11, reported by Andivahis et al. 1994. Rows where angle ~= 90 degrees are marked to be multiplied by a normalizing factor.
ff_plot.py | Generates plots of form factors (seen above) based on results CSVs generated by **rosenbluth.py**
latexify.py | **(not in use)** Converts results CSVs generated by **rosenbluth.py** to LaTeX syntax for tables
rosenbluth.py | Main analysis. Computes form factors and their errors given an input file and normalization factor. Generates output CSV files and form factor distribution histograms.
