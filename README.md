# Frequentist Analysis of Rosenbluth Data: A Study of Proton Form Factor Measurements

These are the Python scripts and subsequent results from this reanalysis of electron-proton scattering data from the NE11 experiment at SLAC (see [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.50.5491)).

## Dependencies
The scripts are written in Python 3.5.2, so **Python 3.0 or greater** is required. **numpy**, **scipy**, and **matplotlib** are required.

## Contents

data5.csv | Annotated 8 GeV and 1.6 GeV scattering data from SLAC NE11, reported by Andivahis et al. 1994. Rows where angle ~= 90 degrees are marked to be multiplied by a normalizing factor.
data_rc.csv | Annotated 8 GeV and 1.6 GeV scattering data from SLAC NE11, reported by Andivahis et al. 1994, with cross sections and their errors multiplied by radiative correction factors (Blunden and Melnitchouk 2017) for 1.75 <= Q^2 <= 5.0.
data_rc2.csv | Annotated 8 GeV and 1.6 GeV scattering data from SLAC NE11, reported by Andivahis et al. 1994, with cross sections and their errors multiplied by radiative correction factors (Blunden and Melnitchouk 2017) for 1.75 <= Q^2 <= 5.0. Rows where angle ~= 90 degrees are marked to be multiplied by a normalizing factor.
ff_plot.py | Generates plots of form factors (seen above) based on results CSVs generated by **rosenbluth.py**
latexify.py | **(not in use)** Converts results CSVs generated by **rosenbluth.py** to LaTeX syntax for tables
rosenbluth.py | Main analysis. Computes form factors and their errors given an input file and normalization factor. Generates output CSV files and form factor distribution histograms.
